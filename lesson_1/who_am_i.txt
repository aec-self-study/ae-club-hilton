My name is Katie Hilton, I use they/them pronouns. I am taking this
class to learn more about the software/ engineering side of data. 
I currently do data anlalytics for a non-profit that does research
on youth civic engagement. I have a history of working in progressive
politics. I am not sure what I want to do next, but I know that I 
really enjoy coding in R and I am hoping to learn more in this class,
gain some skills, and figure out what my next career move is.
